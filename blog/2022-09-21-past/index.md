Sumon Biswas is a Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at Iowa State University (ISU) and a Research Assistant in Laboratory for Software Design at ISU under the supervision of Professor Hridesh Rajan. His research interests are in the intersection of Software Engineering, Programming Languages, and Artificial Intelligence. He has worked on Machine Learning (ML) software repository mining and analysis in large-scale using the Boa framework. He worked on building Python language support for Boa to analyze ML programs and Jupyter Notebooks. Currently, he is working in the D4 (Dependable Data-Driven Discovery) initiative at ISU towards increasing the dependability of data-driven software. Specifically, he is conducting research on understanding the societal bias in ML models and reasoning about fairness property and its mitigation in ML pipelines. His research results appeared in reputed software engineering venues including ICSE and ESEC/FSE.
