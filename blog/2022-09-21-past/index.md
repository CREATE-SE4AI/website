## Trainee Talks Webinar - November 4, 2022

![Trainee_Talk](trainee_talk_1.jpg)

**Topics**: Dependency Management and Testing of AI-based Software Systems

Our monthly **CREATE SE4AI Trainee Talks** webinar series kicked off with 2 graduate Software Engineering students presenting their research.  

In the first of our series of trainee-led webinars, we invited 2 graduate students to deliver their research topics to the broader public. 

**Ahmed Haj Yahmed**, a Master's student at Polytechnique Montréal presented DiverGet: a Search-based Software Testing Approach for Deep Neural Network Quantization Assessment. Immediately following, Concordia University PhD candidate **Jasmine Latendresse** presented her work on software production dependencies which she recently delivered at the IEEE/ACM 2022 Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE '22) in Michigan.

## CREATE SE4AI Retreat - June 3, 2022

Our 1st annual CREATE SE4AI Program Retreat is a wrap! It was an inspiring day of celebrating our collective accomplishments and exchanging ideas amongst an amazing team of students, professors and industry partners, live and in person at the Chateau Vaudreuil. The future is so bright for this group of talented trainees, they’re gonna need shades…

Sumon Biswas is a Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at Iowa State University (ISU) and a Research Assistant in Laboratory for Software Design at ISU under the supervision of Professor Hridesh Rajan. His research interests are in the intersection of Software Engineering, Programming Languages, and Artificial Intelligence. He has worked on Machine Learning (ML) software repository mining and analysis in large-scale using the Boa framework. He worked on building Python language support for Boa to analyze ML programs and Jupyter Notebooks. Currently, he is working in the D4 (Dependable Data-Driven Discovery) initiative at ISU towards increasing the dependability of data-driven software. Specifically, he is conducting research on understanding the societal bias in ML models and reasoning about fairness property and its mitigation in ML pipelines. His research results appeared in reputed software engineering venues including ICSE and ESEC/FSE.
