**Deploying Effective Machine Learning Models in Production: Two Use Cases**

Dr. Gabor Melli, VP of Engineering, AI/ML at San Francisco-based Medable joined us for our first industry talk webinar of 2023! Gabor Melli is a seasoned professional with a proven track record of leading teams and driving positive change within organizations. His background includes implementing evidence-based solutions and facilitating change at large enterprises such as Sony PlayStation, Microsoft, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Wal*Mart, as well as at start-ups including Datasage, Meals.com, VigLink, [OpenGov.com](https://opengov.com/), and [Medable.com](https://www.medable.com/). Gabor has also presented his research at various applied AI research conferences, including AAAI, KDD, LREC, and ICDM. 

**Abstract**

Predictive machine learning has the ability to automate and optimize workflows across a wide range of industries. In this session, we will explore real-life examples of how predictive machine learning is being used at Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) and Medable. At SIE, we will delve into their scalable, real-time, low-latency predictive ML-based solutions that are implemented on the cloud in order to personalize purchasing and playing experiences. Medable, on the other hand, has implemented an automated, decentralized clinical trials platform on the cloud in order to greatly improve efficiency and accuracy. Throughout this session, we will also discuss the role of machine learning engineering and the exciting opportunities that lie ahead in this field. Overall, this session aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the various applications and potential of predictive machine learning.

CREATE SE4AI is pleased to present **AI Adoption in Telecom Networks** as part of our Industry Talks webinar series.

Did you know that revenue generated from AI automation in telecom networks is expected to reach USD 200 billion by 2027? What are some of the current challenges Ericsson, a global leader in ICT solutions faces as they adopt new technologies in AI and ML in their products and services, and how are they overcoming them?

In his presentation, Karthikeyan Premkumar, Data Scientist at Ericsson used case studies to highlight several touchpoints involving the ML model development process, tools, data quality, ML Ops (monitoring and retraining) and deployment as part of model industrialization.

**About the Speaker**

Karthik Premkumar has 18 years of experience in the telecom industry. His expertise lies in industrializing AI/ML solutions, designing system and solution architectures in BSS, Cloud and infrastructure platforms for telecom networks.

In his current role as Data Scientist at Ericsson in Montreal, QC, Karthik Premkumar designs knowledge models and machine reasoning technologies for cognitive networks. He has published over 10 patents and papers on telecom analytics.
