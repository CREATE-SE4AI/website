We hosted our Trainee Talks webinar **on Friday, July 19th, 2024.** It was a great session where we had the opportunity to hear from talented individuals.

University of Alberta Master's candidate **Afiya Fahmida Sarah** shared her insights on “Improving API Documentation Quality Through Identifying Missing Code Examples.” Following Afiya's presentation, Polytechnique Montréal PhD candidate **Patrick Loic Foalem** presented his research on “Studying Logging Practice in Machine Learning-based Applications.”

The Trainee Talks Summer 2024 Edition recording is available to view on our [CREATE SE4AI YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJxl9_ZuFY).
