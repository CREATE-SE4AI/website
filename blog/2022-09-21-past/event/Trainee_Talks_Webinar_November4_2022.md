**Topics**: Dependency Management and Testing of AI-based Software Systems

Our monthly **CREATE SE4AI Trainee Talks** webinar series kicked off with 2 graduate Software Engineering students presenting their research.  

In the first of our series of trainee-led webinars, we invited 2 graduate students to deliver their research topics to the broader public. 

**Ahmed Haj Yahmed**, a Master's student at Polytechnique Montr√©al presented DiverGet: a Search-based Software Testing Approach for Deep Neural Network Quantization Assessment. Immediately following, Concordia University PhD candidate **Jasmine Latendresse** presented her work on software production dependencies which she recently delivered at the IEEE/ACM 2022 Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE '22) in Michigan.

The webinar recording is available to view on our [CREATE SE4AI YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/7owtNM6S0Cg).
