The Gender Equity Mentoring in AI (GEMinAI) Program celebrated the end of a successful first year on May 24th.  Mentors and mentees from the program's inaugural cohort gathered at 4th Space at Concordia to share stories of their mentoring journey.  Jasbir Kooner, MBA (Concordia) and Director, IT and Cybersecurity at Englobe was one of the 13 industry mentors who participated in GEMinAI.  Jasbir shared her experience with the group:

"Thank you to CREATE SE4AI and the<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/concordia-applied-ai-institute/"> Applied AI Institute</a> for creating this incredible program that empowers women and gender non-conforming undergrads and grads who are passionate about AI. Mentoring these past few months has been an amazing experience, and honestly, I've learned just as much from my mentee as she probably learned from me. Programs like these are making sure that the right tools and foundation are there for these participants, so they know they are not alone and can step into the world feeling much more empowered."

Applications for both mentors and mentees will be accepted over the summer and the next cohort will run from October 2024 to May 2025.  For more information on how you can get involved, please contact Lori Akiyama at <a href="mailto:lori.akiyama@concordia.ca">lori.akiyama@concordia.ca</a>.
