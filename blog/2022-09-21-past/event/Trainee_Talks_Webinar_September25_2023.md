Our CREATE SE4AI community came together on September 25th, 2023 for the first Trainee Talks of the fall semester.  We heard Queen's Master's candidate Divya Kamath present her thesis research on Pragmatic Approaches to Schedule Less Builds in Continuous Integration.  Then, Mohayeminul Islam, PhD student from University of Alberta shared his work on Characterizing Python Library Migrations.

The video is now available to view on our [CREATE SE4AI YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/4Mz5tDPFxug).
