Our first Trainee Talks of 2024 was held on Tuesday, February 27th. We welcomed Queen's University Master's student Akshat Malik, who presented his work on Empirical Evaluation of Graph-Anonymized Metrics for JIT Defect Prediction.  Immediately following, Concordia University Master's student Sharon Ho delivered a talk on the Impacts of Text-to-Image Generative AI on Creative Professionals: Insights from Japan.  Both talks were insightful and engaging, generating lots of discussion.

The video is now available to view on our [CREATE SE4AI YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUn62Q1ciWM)
