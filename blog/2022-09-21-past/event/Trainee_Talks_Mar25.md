We hosted our Trainee Talks webinar on **Monday, March 25th, 2024**. It was a great session where we had the opportunity to hear from talented individuals.

Queen’s University Master's student Harsh Patel shared his insights on “Post Deployment Recycling of Machine Learning Models: Don’t Throw Away Your Old Models!”. Following Harsh's presentation, Queen’s University PhD student Fangjian Lei presented his research on “Studying the Evolution Patterns of Self-admitted Technical Debts in Software Systems”.
