**Topics**: Dependency Management and Testing of AI-based Software Systems

Our monthly **CREATE SE4AI Trainee Talks** webinar series kicks off with 2 graduate Software Engineering students presenting their research.  

In the first of our series of trainee-led webinars, we invited 2 graduate students to deliver their research topics to the broader public. 

Join us as we hear from **Ahmed Haj Yahmed**, a Master's student at Polytechnique Montréal as he presents DiverGet: a Search-based Software Testing Approach for Deep Neural Network Quantization Assessment. Immediately following, Concordia University PhD candidate **Jasmine Latendresse** will present her work on software production dependencies which she recently delivered at the IEEE/ACM 2022 Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE '22) in Michigan.

Whether you are a seasoned expert in software engineering or have limited technical knowledge in this field, you are sure to learn something new from Ahmed and Jasmine!

Each talk will be 20 minutes in length, followed by a 10 minute Q&A session.  Come ready to learn something new!
