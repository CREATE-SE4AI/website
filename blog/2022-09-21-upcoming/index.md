**Deploying Effective Machine Learning Models in Production: Two Use Cases**

Join us on Friday, February 10th at 11:30 AM EST as we welcome Dr. Gabor Melli, VP of Engineering, AI/ML at San Francisco-based Medable. Gabor Melli is a seasoned professional with a proven track record of leading teams and driving positive change within organizations. His background includes implementing evidence-based solutions and facilitating change at large enterprises such as Sony PlayStation, Microsoft, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Wal*Mart, as well as at start-ups including Datasage, Meals.com, VigLink, [OpenGov.com](https://opengov.com/), and [Medable.com](https://www.medable.com/). Gabor has also presented his research at various applied AI research conferences, including AAAI, KDD, LREC, and ICDM. 

**Abstract**

Predictive machine learning has the ability to automate and optimize workflows across a wide range of industries. In this session, we will explore real-life examples of how predictive machine learning is being used at Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) and Medable. At SIE, we will delve into their scalable, real-time, low-latency predictive ML-based solutions that are implemented on the cloud in order to personalize purchasing and playing experiences. Medable, on the other hand, has implemented an automated, decentralized clinical trials platform on the cloud in order to greatly improve efficiency and accuracy. Throughout this session, we will also discuss the role of machine learning engineering and the exciting opportunities that lie ahead in this field. Overall, this session aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the various applications and potential of predictive machine learning. 

Dr. Melli’s talk will be followed by a Q&A session.
