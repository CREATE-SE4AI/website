# Mr. Serge Oligny 

## Bio

After obtaining a B.Sc. in computer sciences and an M.Sc. in Mathematics from University of
Sherbrooke, Mr. Oligny started his career as a project manager in software engineering with
a keen interest in applying quantitative methods within this blooming industry in the late ’80
and early ’90. He then got involved in co-authoring a software measurement method and
contributed to turn it into an ISO standard which brought him international contracts at the
turn of the millennium. Backed by his experience with quantitative methods, Mr. Oligny
then got to lead the certification of Bell Canada IS/IT shop at CMM level 3 and used his skills
to develop as a Six Sigma Black Belt in the same organization. Around 2010 his professional
interests turned to machine learning and artificial intelligence; he got involved in leveraging
these tools to improve various aspects of the telecommunication business. Mr. Oligny
joined Desjardins 5 years ago as expert adviser in data sciences for the Modeling and
Research Competency Center (MRCC) at Desjardins General Insurance. He currently
assumes the role of data valuation strategist at Mouvement Desjardins, bridging the gap
between business needs and numerical intelligence technologies. Over his career Mr. Oligny
co-authored several papers and had opportunities to present many of them in America, in
Europe and in Asia. He has been a contributing member to the Standard Council of Canada
for several years.
