# About Us

The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has seen significant demand and growth due to the recent explosion in
datasets and breakthroughs in Machine Learning (ML) such as deep learning and reinforcement learning. Many
organizations are leveraging the benefits of AI in real-world applications across numerous domains such as
healthcare, finance, retail, security, and education. While AI-based systems are ultimately software systems,
current Software Engineering (SE) research/training rarely considers the intricacies (both technical and social)
of building AI-based software systems.

Hence, our objective is to fill the major shortage in highly qualified
personnel (HQP) that can develop, deploy and service AI-based software systems and equally provide the HQP
with a solid background on ethical and social understanding of AI. CREATE SE4AI will be delivered by a team
of world-renowned experts, working closely with leading international and Canadian industrial partners.
CREATE SE4AI will achieve a number of novel and original training components:

- A newly developed course on Engineering AI-based Software Systems.
- A newly developed course on Social Aspects for AI-based Software System.
- Professional Development for AI-based Software System Practitioners modules
- Industrial embedding where graduate trainees will be offered the opportunity to serve one or more internships with our industrial partners
- Industry webinar and/or on-site seminar.
- Carefully selected specialization courses on SE, AI, and social concepts where students will learn about the specific concepts in AI, SE and social aspects.
- Hands-on leadership and mentorship training where trainees will be coached on how to judge AI-based software systems and related projects and publications.

CREATE SE4AI will prepare our next generation of trainees to take on leadership roles such as, team leads, entrepreneurs, policy makers, and professors.
