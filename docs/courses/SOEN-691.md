# SOEN 691: Engineering AI-Based Software Systems

## Background

Software systems play an important role in our daily lives. To ensure relevance and customer satisfaction, software systems need to continuously change. One way to facilitate this continuous change of software systems is to re-engineer them. Software re-engineering is defined as "the examination and alteration of a subject system to reconstitute it in a new form and the subsequent implementation of a new form". Generally speaking, software re-engineering has two phases: a reverse engineering phase where a representation of the system is created through the identification of software components and their relations. The second phase is a forward engineering phase, where a system is reconstructed in a new and improved form. Software re-engineering is often confused with software maintenance, which is more concerned about the modification and adaptation of a software product after delivery.

## Reference Material

The course reference textbook for the course is:

- _Serge Demeyer, Stephane Ducasse, and Oscar Nierstrasz_. **Object-Oriented Reengineering Patterns. Square Bracket Associates**, 2008.

Also, reading materials (i.e., researcher papers) will be assigned and provided.

## Course Outline

Introduction to software re-engineering. Software architecture recovery and reconstruction; Reflexion models; Using development history to support re-engineering. Empirical studies on software re-engineering; Software metrics applied to software re-engineering. Software re-engineering patterns. Software migration strategies. Testing during re-engineering. Re-engineering economics. Integration issues to support emerging environments. A project.

A tentative list of the topics that will be covered in this course is given in the tentative schedule section at the end of this document.

## Web Page

Many resources for the course (lecture slides, assigned readings, example projects, etc.) will be available on the course Moodle website available through MyConcordia portal at www.myconcordia.ca

## Evaluation Scheme

| Component                    | %   |
| ---------------------------- | --- |
| Class participation          | 10  |
| Paper critiques & activities | 20  |
| Project proposal             | 10  |
| Research project             | 30  |
| Final Exam                   | 30  |

1. You must pass the final exam and the course project.
2. There is no standard relationship between percentages and letter grades assigned.
3. All students should become familiar with the University’s Code of Conduct located at http://www.concordia.ca/students/academic-integrity/code.html In cases where cheating or plagiarism is suspected, the case will be forwarded directly to the appropriate university office.

### Class Participation

Students are expected to attend all classes. In each class, we will have discussions based on the assigned readings. Students are expected to participate and make meaningful contributions to these discussions.

### Paper Critiques

We will have two assigned research papers (or chapters) on most weeks. Each student is expected to send a critique of one of the papers that are being presented. The critique should include **a brief summary of the paper, at least three strengths of the paper and at least three weaknesses of the paper**. For the other paper, each student is required to submit a summary of the paper. The critiques and paper summaries are due at noon on Tuesdays. A subset of the paper critiques will be graded in detail, while others will be only graded for completeness.

### Research Proposal and Project

A large portion of the course deliverables is a course research project. You are expected to work on the course project in groups. Each group is expected to write a research paper by the end of the semester. The topic is to be determined with the instructor. Examples include a new contribution on a specific related topic, a survey paper of a related topic (typically involves surveying 30 – 60 papers), or building a tool to support software re-engineering.

**The first deliverable of the course project is a project proposal**. The project proposal should be 3 pages in length (plus references). The project proposal should be submitted by the end of week 7. A project progress presentation will be held in week 7. The final project will be presented in week 13 and the final project report (10 pages in length) should be submitted by the end of week 13. The final submission is expected to be of publishable quality. All project-related documents (i.e., project proposal and project report) should use the IEEE conference publication format.

If the paper is deemed publishable, the instructor will work with the students to make appropriate changes to the final report and submit the paper for publication.
